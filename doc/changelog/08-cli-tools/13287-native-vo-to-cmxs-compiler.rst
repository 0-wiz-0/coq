- **Added:**
  A standalone `coqnative` binary that performs native compilation
  out of `vo` files, allowing to split library compilation from
  native compilation. See :ref:`coqnative`. The hybrid build
  system was adapted to perform a split compilation on the stdlib
  (`#13287 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/13287>`_,
  by Pierre-Marie PÃ©drot).
