- **Removed:**
  Unqualified ``polymorphic``, ``monomorphic``, ``template``,
  ``notemplate`` attributes (they were deprecated since Coq 8.10).
  Use :attr:`universes(polymorphic)`, :attr:`universes(monomorphic)`,
  :attr:`universes(template)` and :attr:`universes(notemplate)` instead
  (`#11663 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/11663>`_, by Th√©o Zimmermann).
