- **Changed:**
  Option -native-compiler of the configure script now impacts the
  default value of the option -native-compiler of coqc. The
  -native-compiler option of the configure script is added an ondemand
  value, which becomes the default, thus preserving the previous default
  behavior.
  The stdlib is still precompiled when configuring with -native-compiler
  yes. It is not precompiled otherwise.
  This an implementation of point 2 of
  `CEP #48 <https://github.com/coq/ceps/pull/48>`_
  (`#13352 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/13352>`_,
  by Pierre Roux).
