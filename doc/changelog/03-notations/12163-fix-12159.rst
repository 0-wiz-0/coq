- **Fixed:**
  Numeral Notations now play better with multiple scopes for the same
  inductive type. Previously, when multiple numeral notations were defined
  for the same inductive, only the last one was considered for
  printing. Now, among the notations that are usable for printing and either
  have a scope delimiter or are open, the selection is made according
  to the order of open scopes, or according to the last defined
  notation if no appropriate scope is open
