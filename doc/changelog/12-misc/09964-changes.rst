- Changelog has been moved from a specific file `CHANGES.md` to the
  reference manual; former Credits chapter of the reference manual has
  been split in two parts: a History chapter which was enriched with
  additional historical information about Coq versions 1 to 5, and a
  Changes chapter which was enriched with the content formerly in
  `CHANGES.md` and `COMPATIBILITY`
