- **Fixed:**
  Ensure that the names of arguments of inductive schemes are distinct
  so that the new Coq 8.15 preservation of argument names in the ``with``
  clause of tactics in `#13837 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/13837>`_
  work as in Coq 8.14 for these schemes
  (`#15537 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/15537>`_,
  fixes `#15420 <https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/15420>`_,
  by Hugo Herbelin).
