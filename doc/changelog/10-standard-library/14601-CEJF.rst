- **Changed:**
  The new type of  `epsilon_smallest` is
  `(exists n : nat, P n) -> { n : nat | P n /\ forall k, P k -> n <= k }`.
  Here the minimality of [n] is expressed by `forall k, P k -> n <= k`
  corresponding to the intuitive meaning of minimality
  "the others are greater", whereas the previous version used
  the negative equivalent formulation `forall k, k < n -> ~P k`.
  Scripts using `epsilon_smallest` can easily be adapted using
  lemmas `le_not_lt` and `lt_not_le` from the standard library.
