- **Changed:**
  Notations :n:`[|@term|]` and :n:`[||@term||]` for morphisms from 63-bit
  integers to :g:`Z` and :g:`zn2z int` have been removed in favor of
  :n:`φ(@term)` and :n:`Φ(@term)` respectively. These notations were
  breaking Ltac parsing (`#11686 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/11686>`_,
  by Maxime Dénès).
