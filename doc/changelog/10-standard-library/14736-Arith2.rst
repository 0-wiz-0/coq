- **Deprecated:**
  some obsolete files from the ``Arith`` part of the standard library
  (``Div2``, ``Even``, ``Gt``, ``Le``, ``Lt``, ``Max``, ``Min``, ``Minus``, ``Mult``, ``NPeano``, ``Plus``).
  Import ``Arith_base`` instead of these files.  References to items in the deprecated files should be replaced
  with references to ``PeanoNat.Nat`` as suggested by the warning messages.
  All ``Hint`` declarations in the ``arith`` database have been moved to ``Arith_prebase`` and
  ``Arith_base``.  To use the results about Peano arithmetic, we recommend importing
  ``PeanoNat`` (or ``Arith_base`` to base it on the ``arith`` hint database) and using the ``Nat`` module.
  ``Arith_prebase`` has been introduced temporarily to ensure compatibility, but it will be removed at the end of the
  deprecation phase, e.g. in 8.18.  Its use is thus discouraged.
