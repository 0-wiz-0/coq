- **Changed:**
  The algorithm for name generation of anonymous variables
  for ``Program`` subproofs is now the same as the one
  used in the general case. This can create incompatibilities
  in scripts relying on such autogenerated names. The old
  scheme can be reactivated using the deprecated flag
  :flag:`Program Naming`
  (`#15442 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/15442>`_,
  by Pierre-Marie PÃ©drot).
