# Support #

Get in touch with the user community and ask questions about Coq on
our [Discourse forum][]. Posts in other languages than English are
explicitly welcome there. There is also a historic mailing list called
the [Coq-Club][] which has lots of subscribers, and an IRC channel
(`irc://irc.freenode.net/#coq`).

In addition, you may also ask questions about Coq on [Stack
Overflow][] (use the tag [coq][Stack Overflow tag]) or on the
meta-theory of Coq on the [TCS Stack Exchange][] (which also has a
[coq][TCS SE tag] tag).

You can reach the Coq development team through the [development
category][] of the above mentioned Discourse forum, the [Gitter
channel][], and of course the bug tracker.
