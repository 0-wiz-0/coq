# Coq Code of Conduct #

The Coq development team and the user community are made up of a mixture of
professionals and volunteers from all over the world.

Diversity is a strength, but it can also lead to communication issues and
unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to
adhere to. This code applies equally to core developers (who should lead by
example), occasional contributors and those seeking help and guidance. The
goal of these rules is that everyone feels safe when contributing to Coq or
interacting with others in Coq related forums.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Coq development team.
This includes the GitHub repository, the mailing lists, the Gitter channel,
physical events like Coq working groups and workshops, and any other forums
created or managed by the development team which the community uses for
communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may
affect a person's ability to participate within them.

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.**
  We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all
  backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of
  any origin, colour, status, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity, age, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
  ability.
- **Be considerate.**
  Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
  work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
  you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be respectful.**
  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
  behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and
  then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
  It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable
  or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Coq development team
  and user community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
  well as with people outside the community.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.**
  We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
  Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment
  and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
  * Violent language or threats or personal insults have no chance to
    resolve a dispute or to let a discussion florish. Worse, they can
    hurt durably, or generate durable fears. They are thus unwelcome.
  * Not everyone is comfortable with sexually explicit or violent
    material, even as a joke. In an online open multicultural world, you
    don't know who might be listening. So be cautious and responsible
    with your words.
  * Discussions are online and recorded for posterity; we all have our
    right for privacy and online gossiping as well as posting or
    threatening to post other people's personally identifying
    information is unwelcome.
- **Remember that what you write in a public online forum might be read by
  many people you don't know.**
  Consider what image your words will give to outsiders of the development
  team / the user community as a whole. Try to avoid references to private
  knowledge to be understandable by anyone.
- **When we disagree, try to understand why.**
  Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Coq is no
  exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
  constructively. Remember that we're different. There is strength in a varied
  community, with people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
  have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone
  holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is
  human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus
  on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
- **Coq online forums are only to discuss Coq-related subjects.**
  Unrelated policitical discussions or long disgressions are unwelcome,
  even for illustration or comparison purposes.

## Enforcement ##

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing the Coq Code of Conduct enforcement team at
<coq-conduct@inria.fr>. Confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident will be maintained while dealing with it.

In particular, you should seek support from the team instead of dealing by
yourself with a behavior that you consider hurtful.

Depending on the violation, the team can choose to address a private or public
warning to the offender, request an apology, or ban them for a short or a long
period of time from interacting on one or all of our forums.

## Questions? ##

If you have questions, feel free to write to <coq-conduct@inria.fr>.
