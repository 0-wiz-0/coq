# Coq Test Suite

The test suite can be run from the Coq root directory by `make test-suite`.
This does a clean step first, so if you've already run it, then change something,
you'll have to do a lot of work again.

If you run `make` from the `test-suite` directory, there is no clean step.
You can also run `make aaa/bbb/ccc.v.log` to build the log for one test,
or `make ddd` where `ddd` is on of the sub-directories of `test-suite`
to just build the logs for that directory.
In these cases, a summary is not printed, but can be generated by `make summary`.

`make -B` can be used to rerun tests ( -B meaning always remake).

See [`test-suite/Makefile`](/test-suite/Makefile) for more information.

## Adding a test

Regression tests for closed bugs should be added to `test-suite/bugs/closed`, as `1234.v` where `1234` is the bug number.
Files in this directory are tested for successful compilation.
When you fix a bug, you should usually add a regression test here as well.

The error "(bug seems to be opened, please check)" when running `make test-suite` means that a test in `bugs/closed` failed to compile.

There are also output tests in `test-suite/output` which consist of a `.v` file and a `.out` file with the expected output.
